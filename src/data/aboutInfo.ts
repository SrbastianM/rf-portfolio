        text: `Hello everyone my name is Sebastian a software developer who enjoys open source and constantly learning about the internet and how it is transforming over time, but since you are here I guess you have read this on the main page, so let me talk about my studies and professional experience.
        About 5 years ago I set my eyes on a career in programming and wrote my first “Hello Meow!”. (Yes! it sounds a bit weird but at that moment I felt safe writing this instead of “Hello World”). At that moment I thought, what do I do to schedule every day? I made bad decisions because the answer to that question is: Coding every day!... instead I studied a Technological career in a Colombian institute called S.E.N.A, for a non Colombian person it sounds like a bootcamp or something similar but it's more than that, it's a pretty small step away from being a University for the proletarian people (because it focuses on making workers instead of good programmers).
        Well, I finished that career and I got my first job in the industry as a QA... And for the next three years of my life I was the saddest person in the world...
        Now you may be thinking, instead of being a page about, this seems like a sad story of his life and it is (in a way). This job took everything from me, my happiness, my emotional stability and of course my peace. Now it's safe to think, why didn't I get out of this job, I thought that in those years I could improve my professional skills and maybe get a change of role in the company to a development team.... And so I did! In my last months in the company I was moved to a development team as a Full-stack developer using React and ExpressJS.  To my surprise, I was fired two months after the role change, it is the most horrible thing I have ever experienced, because the company never told me why. I have a lot of mixed feelings with this company, first of all it was my first job and they taught me why QA teams will disappear.... The skill set of a QA has not changed over time and it is not surprising that their senior managers maintain archaic attitudes and are not good at teaching their successors, also in this company I experienced my first harassment at work.
        There were many reasons why I couldn't leave the job so I just shut up and continued... During those years I took advantage of my salaries to buy courses on different platforms like Udemy and Platzi where I learned to create and maintain web and mobile apps.
        This experience made me grow as a person, taught me what responsibility is and how important it is to raise my voice when necessary. Now that I have some extra “freedom” I focus my studies on web development and hope to get a job as a web developer someday. 
        If you got to this point thank you very much for reading me!!! this has been my experience in the area and some of my impressions about it, after finishing this project I will start my blog so there I will probably write more in depth my point of view based on my experience as a QA and my current studies.
        Thanks to all!
